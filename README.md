# RateIt

### Description

RateIt is an app similar to `RateMyProfessors` but improved with extra functionalities. The initial idea started as part of a school project, which can be viewed **[here](https://github.com/goto1/is661)**, along with the **[prototype](https://goto1.github.io/is661/docs/key-path-scenario/index.html)**... I decided to turn the prototype into a working application using `React` and `Firebase`.
